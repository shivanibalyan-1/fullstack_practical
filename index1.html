    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.</p>
    <li>Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.</li>
    <li>As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</li>
    
    <p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.</p>
    
    <p>Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available in HTML language.</p>
    <li>HTML is the language for publishing web pages on the WWW (World-Wide Web).</li>
    <li>HTML is a Document Description Language (aka Document Markup Language). HTML is NOT a programming language like C/C++/C#/Java, which is used to implement programming algorithm.</li>
    <li>You need a web browser to view the HTML pages. The web browsers do not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the web pages.
    </li>
    <li>An HTML document is a text document, and it is human-readable.</li>
